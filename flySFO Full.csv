SeaTac Uber pickup is interesting as you have UberSELECT, UberBLACK,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The curb is nightmare! Lyft and Uber were doing pickups in at International departure and vice versa.

I land at SFO as frequently as I depart. The problems are always for departing passengers. Which should never be the case.,"2017-12-16T22:27:06.000Z""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Technically they do. But they're just in between terminals on the departure level, which causes tons of congestion upstairs. It's not helpful at all.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
OTOH, the quicker people get OUT of the airport area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So true & what makes @ flysgo worse u pick up ride share upstairs at departing flights. As u said many airports have specific areas in parking garages for rides shares which is so much easier.,"2017-12-16T22:10:59.000Z""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I totally agree, the car service situation at the airport is a disaster. @ flySFO please fix this!,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
LAX has designated pick-up areas for ride-sharing services.,"2017-12-16T22:03:44.000Z""""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
No airport should prioritize passengers who already have landed over those trying to catch flights, but the current system jeopardizes those trying to actually make their flights. Insanity.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Interestingly, JFK has moved the YELLOW cabs out of the arrival area so that getting a rideshare is easier. At least,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Other airports in the US have dealt with the problem of a flood of unregulated car services by forcing the, into new pickoff spots in the garage. It works. @ flysfo needs to do this now and stop punishing travelers driven by friends/family.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is well and good, I'd recommend it because @ flySFO is a zoo right now. But @ flysfo is still not doing what it should and move all @ lyft and @ uber pickups/dropoffs to garage. Airport solution is forcing folks who are NOT the problem away from curbside,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Sorry to hear you had to wait for a wheelchair and hoping you made your flight. Wheelchairs are ordered through the airlines, not the airport. If you send more details we can bring it to your airline’s station manager’s attention.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hey @ flySFO You are failing at accessibility I pre-booked a wheelchair and arrived 90 mins before my flight. The wait for chairs was 30 mins, and it took more than 30 mins for the 6 chairs in front of me to clear security. I didn't get to my gate until the final boarding call.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We're sorry to hear this, Brianne. Please DM your confirmation code so that we may take a closer look into what happened.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
I've been in the security line for wheelchair users for over 20 minutes. There were only 6 people in front of me. They have cleared out the entire other line during this time. Pro tip: if you're going to make people wait 30+ mins for wheelchairs, maybe don't also eff their line.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
